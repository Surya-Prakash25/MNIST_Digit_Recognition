# MNIST_Digit_Recognition

## MNIST CNN Classifier
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn


You can install these libraries using pip:

$ pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Running the Notebook
1) Clone the repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-cnn-classifier.git
$ cd mnist-cnn-classifier

2) Open the Jupyter notebook:

$ jupyter notebook MNIST_CNN.ipynb

3) Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells and train the model.

## Notebook Contents
1) Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
2) Split Data: Load the MNIST dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
3) Preprocess Data: Normalize the data and reshape it to fit the CNN model.
4) Build Model: Define the CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras layers.
5) Compile Model: Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
6) Train Model: Train the model using the training data.
7) Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
8) Visualize Results: Visualize the model's performance through graphs and sample predictions.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits.
